# Simon Berens's Reference

### What is Reference?
This my implementation of the algorithms, data structures, and programming challenges that I come across.

### What is the purpose of Reference?
I hope writing out detailed implementations with explanations will increase my skills as a programmer. I also hope to 
see how my coding style and ability changes over time. In addition to personal benefits, I hope that this repository
will help others understand the concepts here through my explanations. 

### Current Languages
- C++
- Python
